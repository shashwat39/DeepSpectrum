# Spectrum Sensing Using Deep Learning

Efficient spectrum sensing is crucial for cognitive radios to manage frequency bands effectively. In this study, we propose a new method using deep learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our approach trains on a diverse dataset of different signals and noise, allowing it to learn and detect new signals. We also use pretrained models to improve accuracy further. Our experiments show our method performs better than traditional methods in detecting real-world signals.
